INTRODUCTION                                    *vimlocalmacros*

vimlocalmacros is a plugin that allows local storage and execution of macros
within a file. Sometimes when editing a particular file you have the need to
perform a certain set of operations regularly and to make that easier you
create a macro. It would be nice to store that macro with the file so that
it's easily available again the next time you edit it. The vimlocalmacros
plugin stores macros using the file's comment strings.

At the moment, macros are stored and executed manually (with <leader>mw and
<leader>mr respectively by default), however it is conceivable that this could
be automated with a BufEnter,BufRead autocommand. This functionality has NOT
been implemented yet due to security concerns.

MARKER                                          *vimlocalmacros-marker*

VimLocalMacros uses   comment-starter + 'vlm:' + comment-trailer   as a marker
to signify that this comment contains a macro definition.

USAGE                                           *vimlocalmacros-usage*

With your cursor on a VLM line (See |vimlocalmacros-marker|), the normal mode
key sequence:   <leader>mr   will execute the macro definition.

To save a macro definition on the current line, use the normal mode key
sequence:   <leader>mw

ISSUES                                          *vimlocalmacros-issues*
